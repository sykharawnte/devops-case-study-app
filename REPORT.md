# 📄 DevOps Project Report

This report provides a complete overview of the DevOps automation project using **Terraform**, **Ansible**, **Jenkins**, **Git**, **GitHub**, and **Docker**.
The goal of this project is to provision an EC2 instance, configure the environment, and deploy a Dockerized application using CI/CD automation.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Diagram

### Explanation:

* **GitHub** hosts the code and triggers **Jenkins** via webhooks
* **Jenkins** executes the CI/CD pipeline on commit
* **Terraform** provisions the AWS EC2 instance and networking components
* **Ansible** configures the instance (installs Docker, Jenkins, etc.)
* **Docker** builds and runs the application container

## 🌿 Branching Strategy

We followed a simple **GitFlow** branching strategy:

* `main`: Stable code, ready for production
* `dev`: Active development
* `feature/*`: Created from `dev` for working on specific features or components

🔐 All changes are merged into `main` via pull requests after successful testing.

## 🔁 Jenkins Pipeline Execution

The Jenkins pipeline is defined in a `Jenkinsfile` that automates the following tasks:

### Pipeline Stages:

1. **Checkout Code**
2. **Terraform Init & Apply**
3. **Run Ansible Playbook**
4. **Build and Deploy Docker Image**
